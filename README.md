# Fifa-Deep-Dive
Fifa Deep Dive is a stats-tracking single page application using React. It came to life as an idea between me and my friend as we're pretty competitive and played Fifa often. We then came up with this idea, so we can actually see how we play against each other and keep track of our performance over time.
